# Rust Slicer experiments

This repository contains the experiments used for the POPL'22 submission, "Modular Program Slicing Through Ownership". Layout:
* `deps` contains dependencies for evaluation, namely forks of `rust` and `cargo`, as well as `rust-slicer` that implements the algorithm described in Sections 4/5
* `data` contains data generated by the experiments after execution
* `eval` contains the code for using the slicer to run the evaluation
* `notebooks` contains Jupyter notebooks used to run and analyze the evaluation
* `init.sh` builds dependencies and downloads the dataset

## Running the evaluation

This has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04. You must have installed:
* git
* Python 3.7
* Rust (including cargo and rustup)

Optionally, but recommended: create a Python virtual environment like so:
```
python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
```

Then initialize the experiment by running:

```
./init.sh
```

Then start Jupyter by runnin:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Then visit `notebooks/execute.ipynb`. Click "Cell > Run All" to generate the data.

Then visit `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`. Click "Cell > Run All" to see the corresponding analyses, including graphs used in the paper.
